# WEBSYS ACT2 SUBMISSION

## Information
- Name: Montemor, Gian Nestor Ace B.  
- Student ID: 2024301739

## Overview
- Tech & Lifestyle Weekly is a multi-page magazine-style website focused on technology, lifestyle, and digital culture. The design is inspired from the aesthetic of the works of Korean video-game company, Project Moon. I used a dark theme with muted gold accents for that hint of professionalism.

## Bonus Feature
- Contact Page: I added a small contact page where the user of the page can send requests, comments, criticisms, and everything in between to the "company" if need be. The form doesn't actually do anything, it is non-functional. I just picked the contact page as a bonus page since i feel like it's the easiest one to do among the other webpages
